### Linear-Programming-Model
----
Overview

This was a collaborative effort by Jackie Mease, Tyler Harris, Johnathan Sparger, Kyle Anderson, and myself, Christopher McManus for Dr. Xiuli He's Decision Modeling and Analysis course at UNC Charlotte's School of Data Science. 

The goal for this project was to solve a linear programming problem where a golf club manufacturer desired to maximize its profit margin using given revenues, costs, and contraints.

The linear programming problem considered these four questions...

1.) Create a spreadsheet model for this problem and solve it. What is the optimal solution?

2.) If Rick wanted to improve this solution, what additional resources would be needed and where would they be needed? Explain.

3.) What would TGL's optimal profit be if the company was not required to supply at least 90% of each distributor's order?

4.) Suppose TGL's agreement included the option of paying a $10,000 penalty if the company cannot supply at least 90% of each distributor's order but instead supply at least 80% of eachg distributor's order. Comment of the pros and cons of TGL excerising this option. 

To help the golf club manufacturer maximize its profit margin, we first had to identify and define the decision variables given in the prompt. The golf club manufacturer produced men's, women's, and junior's golf clubs, and shipped them from either Daytona, FL, Memphis, TN, or Tempe, AZ to distributor's in either Sacramento, CA, Denver, CO, or Pittsburgh, PA, based on resource availability and demand. All resource constraints used in the manufacturing of each golf club can be found in the "Linear Programming Problem Prompt" file. Once the decision variables were created, we then had to define the objective function. In this case, the objective function was to find the least costly shipping destination(s) to fulfill all golf club orders that would maximize profit. The optimal solution to the golf club manufacturers request can be found in the "Linear Programming Model and Results" file. After determining the optimal solution, we then attempted to see if the optimal solution could be improved with additional resources. Lastly, we attempted to resolve the problem with two modified demand constraints. The latter of which had two solutions due to different interpretations of question 4 between group members.

To reproduce this project, download the "Linear Programming Problem Prompt" file, determine the objective function and constraints, and then use solver in excel!
